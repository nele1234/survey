My application is going to be survey, any customer can answer it annonimly and get average results untill that moment. If customer want to post some survey he has to make registration and log to page. 

Customer will have options to change password, change username.
Also any customer will be able to send feedback about any survey he wish.
In login page customer will have password match so he can't miss his password.
Also password will have validation, it will check password simbols.
When someone make new registration, he will not be able use email or username that is already used.
After registration is finished customer will be relocated to main page where he can put his survey or answer survey that already exist.
Survey will have multiple choice answers.
All of that depends on customer that make survey, number of questions, offered number of answers
At the end it will have submit butter that will locate customer to feedback option.
